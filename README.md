# Capstone Game for Computer Science class, created April 2018
The Blind Guardian's Crypt is a basic Python rpg game created using the spgl library.

I did not make any of the graphics or music. All graphics were found online and are free to use. Several were slightly modified by me, but all are easily recognizable.
